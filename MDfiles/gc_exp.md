## Use of Force vs Officer Years on Force
This graph goes over the correlation of use of force and experience of officers. Based on the graph, it is clear to see that officers with less experience show more instances. The red trend line of no use of force shows a decline in the number of instances as the number of years of experience increases. In other words, officers that have less experience are more likely to have more instances than those who have more experience. The blue trend line for use of force remains constant except for between the years of 0 and 10 years of experience where there is a short incline in the number of instances that used force. Seeing that the use of force happened between 0 and 10 years of experience could be due to the lack of experience for these officers where force is the option they turn to because they do not know what else to do. Overall the graph lets us understand that the use of force among Seattle police is not common but when it happens, it is more likely to occur with officers with less experience.
