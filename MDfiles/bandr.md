#### **Description**
Police use of force has been a hot topic in Seattle. Many question the extent to which police use force in any situation and also believe that there are other motivating factors. This project aims to analyze how race, age, years of service, and gender play a role in the use of force for police in the city of Seattle. With the increase in racial and political conflicts in recent years, opinions on the police are very polarizing.

A general perception that police have increased their frequency and extent of their use of force has worried much of the public. Bringing into question whether race, age, years of service, or gender play a factor in situations when use of force is warranted. This problem affects all people of every background and has caused many to worry if there is a hidden problem within the police departments in King county.

This project uses five distinct factors; race, experience, precinct, time of incident, and gender, to analyze which, if any, play a role in the frequency of police use of force and its extent. A combination of graphs and diagrams will be used to depict each factor and the role it plays in the use of force.
