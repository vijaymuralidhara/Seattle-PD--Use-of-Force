## Strengths and Weaknesses
### Strengths
Our research questions and data are heavily correlated -- investigating the data has proved very interesting and insightful in terms of answering our initial research questions.
The code for our projectâ€™s files is well organized and easy to read. This helps with future alterations, and keeping everything efficient.
Visualizations -- our visualizations can be utilized to help answer each of our research questions. They explain the data well in each subset option, and present a user-friendly interface.
### Weaknesses
We hope to add components to our Shiny app in order to make it even more user-friendly by adding interactive features.
Collaboration has proven difficult over git, especially when multiple members are working on the same piece of code. This was expected, but in the future we intend to communicate

## Lessons Learned
The majority of our learning for this deliverable was centralized around developing the Shiny application, and how we needed to wrangle our data in order to develop informative visualizations.
In terms of team chemistry, our meetings have been frequent and informative for all group members. In the future, our division of work needs to be more clearly defined at the start of the deliverable (in case of potential roadblocks appearing close to the deliverable due date).

## Future Work
The majority of our group wants to work in fields that employ the use of statistical analysis, machine learning, or technical coding. This project has taught us a lot about working collaboratively in a technical team setting, especially because we are learning the tools at the same time.
Many of our desired fields of work involve data wrangling, and visualizing data through some method to convey to a group who may or may not understand the technical inner-workings. This project was a great demonstration of how to build the app technically, but also present our insights in a way that any user could understand.
