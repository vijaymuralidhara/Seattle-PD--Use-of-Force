## Use of Force vs Officer Race
The Use of Force and Office Race Correlation visualizes whether or not force was used out of the total number of incidents, categorized by the race of the officer involved. Races included are as follows: American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Not Specified, Two or More Races, Unknown, or White.

The range of ratio percentages (# of Force Used: (Yes) / # of Instances) on average ranged from 1% to just over 2%. The glaring exception to the other columns is the White (Race of Officer) column -- it’s ratio is .002209%. This column is considered an outlier, and was neglected from the range of ratio percentages because the number of instances is far larger than any other racial group.

In summary, no direct correlation can be observed from this data set that implicates a police officer’s race affects their use of force during an encounter.
