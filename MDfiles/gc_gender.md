## Use of Force vs Officer Gender
The Use of Force and Gender Correlation depicts the number of times force was or was not used among male, female, and non-identifying police officers. It is quite clear that the police force is primarily male and explains the fact that those identifying as male had the most instances of using force. However, when taking into account the proportion of those who used force and those who didnâ€™t, surprisingly police officers who are non-identifying had a 2.33% use of force among the group, while male officers had a close 2.05% use of force among the group and female officers had the lowest at 1.83% use of force among their group.
