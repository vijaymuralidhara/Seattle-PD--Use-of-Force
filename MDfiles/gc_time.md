## Use of Force vs Reported Time of Incidences
The graph describes how a police officer’s use of force is affected by the time of day. Distinct times may cause officer’s to react differently when faced with a difficult situation. In this graph, specifically, the trend of the line is a little all over the place. However, the overall graph seems to increase in the dark hours of the day and decrease in the middle hours of the day. For instance, the maximum time of reported incidences was 12:15 am in the city of Seattle. Meanwhile, the time with the minimum reported incidences was 9:45 am in Seattle. Therefore, from the graph we can interpret that in the city of Seattle, police officer’s are more likely to use force in the night than they are throughout the day.
