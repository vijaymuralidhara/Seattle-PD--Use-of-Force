## 1.0 Introduction

**1.1 Problem Situation.**
* Stakeholders
  * Police officers, non-officer law enforcement personnel, 911 callers, lawmakers. <br />
* Setting
  * The project research will focus on the City of Seattle (domestic residences and businesses). <br />
* Values and tensions
  * Safety: how safe do resident’s feel reaching out to the police based upon their personal attributes and circumstances. <br />
* Policy and ethic elements
  * Ethics: does an officer’s code of ethics influence their use of force?
  * Policy: will lawmakers be influenced to act based on the insights produced by dataset analysis?

**1.2 What is the problem?** <br />
Police use of force has been a hot topic in Seattle. Many question the extent to which police use force in any situation and also believe that there are other motivating factors. This project aims to analyze how race, age, years of service, and gender play a role in the use of force for police in the city of Seattle. With the increase in racial and political conflicts in recent years, opinions on the police are very polarizing.

**1.3 What does it matter?** <br />
A general perception that police have increased their frequency and extent of their use of force has worried much of the public. Bringing into question whether race, age, years of service, or gender play a factor in situations when use of force is warranted. This problem affects all people of every background and has caused many to worry if there is a hidden problem within the police departments in King county.

**1.4 How it will be addressed?** <br />
This project uses four distinct factors; race, age, years of service, and gender, to analyze which, if any, play a role in the frequency of police use of force and its extent. A combination of graphs and diagrams will be used to depict each factor and the role it plays in the use of force.

## 2.0 Research Questions
RQ #1: How does race, age, years of service, and gender influence police use of force? <br />
RQ #2: Does the time of day influence the type and extent to which force is used?

## 3.0 Possible data sets

## 4.0 Information Visualizations
**Visualization #1: Graph**
## ![](https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/graphics/win64/CompareTypesOfBarGraphsExample_01.png)
*Caption: This information visualization will help represent how different variables and factors influence the police’s overall use of force in various situations in the city of Seattle. Graphs will help us see the correlation between these factors and analyze them to see their relationship.*

**Visualization #2: Map**
## ![](https://maps-seattle.com/img/0/map-of-seattle-washington.jpg)
*Caption: Maps allow us to see where the concentration of Seattle crime stats lie and why. If we input or view different values, we can see either growth or reduction of crime in certain areas of Seattle.*

## 5.0 Team Coordination
**Weekly time(s) that everyone in the group can get together for at least 2 hours**
* Our group has decided to meet Fridays at 11:30 - 2:30 (variable depending on class availability). Frequency of meeting will increase as to finalize pieces of the project in-person. We will also decide potential meetings as deadlines approach/if needed. <br />

**Your individual goal(s) for the project and your roles**
* Adhere to meeting times.
* Communicate effectively about your progress and if you are unable to make a meeting/need to reschedule.
* Upload individual contributions in a timely manner.
* Centralize communication and document storage (google drive and GitHub). <br />

**Roles:**
  * Team Manager: Vijay <br />
  * Designer: Connor <br />
  * Lead IT Specialist: Reyan <br />
  * Technical Writer: Kirstie <br />

**A commitment on how you will communicate weekly**
* Our group will communicate mainly over Facebook messenger, since it will be easy to send links and files over Facebook messenger, and also use iMessage for ease of messaging. We have decided that all our group members must reply back in at least 12 hours unless asked a direct yes or no question or if a deadline is approaching in less than 12 hours.
* Communication should be consistent throughout the week remotely; along with checking in at lab sections.
* Our team has created a shared google drive so that we can all easily access documents and files, and work with each other online in real time. <br />

**A commitment on how you will give each other feedback on working together and how you will address communication challenges or work breakdowns.**
* Feedback will be oriented around the behavior of a group member, not the members themselves.
* Feedback should be constructive, and delivered in a positive manner.
* There will be a general acceptance that feedback is solely given to improve the quality of the project.
