# Introduction <br />
Our project is focusing on how demographics relate to the use of force of police in Seattle. We are doing this project because we want to know if demographics play a factor in how much force police use on a person since in today’s society, police have been known to use excessive amount of force on certain groups compared to others. We hope to gain a better understanding on this topic as well as become more informed on what is really going on in the world around us.
